      <div class=" text-light bg-dark bg-opacity-50"><h3 style ="text-align: center"></h3>
        <p>for element 5 i set up 2 different scenes, with different sizes, shapes, textures and lighting. with GUI buttons to allow the user to switch between scenes at will.</p>
                
                <p>to change the sizes of the shapes all i had to do was use a function to create the mesh and then "let" the mesh have my preffered "height" and "diameter", so by changing those varibles i had near full control of the size of the mesh's</p>
                
                <p>i sourced the textures from the lecturer of the course, using a github repository that he made public i was able to source the textures i needed. i applied these textures to the main (biggest) object in the first scene, as well as the 2 smaller shapes (cyllinder and cube) in the second.</p>
                

                
               <p>for the lights i set up a hemispheric light in each scene, i wanted to make them different so in the first scene i made it have a red/pink lighting with green reflections, with a lower intensity and for the second scene i chose to use a noticeably more intense light and made it green.</p> 
                
                    <p>for this i created a function in the createstartscene for both scenes named "createhemisphericlight", in this function i created a new light for the scene and tweaked the lighting values, to do this i changed the light.diffuse, light.specular and light.groundColor, to make the first scene a pinkish colour i set </p>
                        <p>light.diffuse = (1, 0, 0);</p>
                        <p>light.specular = (0, 1, 0);</p>
                        <p>light.groundColor =(0, 1, 0);</p>
                
                    <p>and for the second scene to make it green i set </p>
                        <p>light.diffuse = new Color3(0, 1, 0);</p>
                        <p>light.specular = new Color3(0, 1, 0);</p>
                        <p>light.groundColor = new Color3(0, 0, 1);</p>
                
                    <p>this gave me the lighting i wanted for these scenes and helped very clearly differentiate them</p>
                
                
                <p>once i had the scenes set up all i had to do was add a GUI so the player could switch between them, to do this i created a seperate file just for GUI (the arcrotatecamera is also created with this file)</p>
                
                <p>i created a multiple functions in this file</p>
                        <p>one of them was to export (menuscene) which allows the function to be used from different files</p>
                
                        <p>another being (createscenebutton) which allowed for the scenes to call a premade button design to the scene and then be edited to do whatever its purpose is.</p>
                
                    <p>both of the scenes call those functions to allow the player to move between the multi scene easily.</p>
